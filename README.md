# Customer Satisfaction Classification using SVM

This project uses a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify customer satisfaction in the airline industry. 
The model is trained using features like flight duration, baggage complaints, in-flight service scores, and overall satisfaction ratings.

## Features

- **Flight Duration**: Duration of the flight in hours.
- **Baggage Complaints**: Number of baggage-related complaints.
- **In-flight Services Score**: Customer rating for in-flight services (1-5 scale).
- **Overall Satisfaction**: Customer rating for overall satisfaction (1-5 scale).

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language for data analysis and model development.
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library used for building and evaluating the SVM model.
- **pandas**: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: Library for numerical computing.
- **matplotlib**: Library for data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development environment for writing and running the code.
